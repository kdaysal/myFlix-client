# myFlix-Client
Hosted on Netlify at: https://kdaysal-myflixapp.netlify.app

## Description
This repo will house the client-side code of a Single Page Application called 'myFlix', which builds upon pre-existing server-side code written as a REST API and hosted online using MongoAtlas.

## Purpose
* Using react, build the client-side for the myFlix application to provide users with a way to easily access basic information about popular movies, genres, and directors so they can learn more about movies that they might want to see later.

* Allow users to create a profile for the purpose of 'favoriting' (saving) movies that they are interested in, and persist this data between different sessions so users won't lose the movies that they had previously marked as favorites.

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to access information on movies, directors, and genres so that I
can learn more about movies Iâ€™ve watched or am interested in

* As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.
